#Hidden Item Game

##Introduction
This is a simple command-line program for a hidden item game. In this game, you are placed in a grid with various obstacles (marked as #), clear paths (marked as .), and a starting position (marked as X). Your objective is to find the hidden item within the grid. 

You must navigate in a specific order: first moving up (North), then right (East), and finally down (South). The program will provide you with a list of probable coordinates where the item might be located, and it can also display the grid with the probable item locations marked with a "$" symbol.

##Grid Layout
The grid is represented using the following symbols:
"#": Obstacles
".": Clear paths
"X": Starting position
"$": Probable item locations (only displayed in the grid when showing the results)

##Running the Program
To run the program, simply execute the provided PHP script . The program will display the list of probable item locations in the grid and mark it as '$'.

``` php script
php hiddenitem.php
```

##Additional Features
Bonus points can be earned for displaying the grid with the probable item locations marked with a "$" symbol.
